# Deep_Learning_Specialisation

Purpose: I am a Python beginner and feel interested in deep learning field.
By creating this individual project, I would not only like to keep record what I have learnt from deep learning courses, but also share what I learnt with the ones who enjoy learning from the courses as well.

# Course 1. Neural Networks and Deep Learning
